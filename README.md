# Next.js BFF (Backend for Frontend) Aggregation Pattern

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Architecture-BFF%20Pattern-blue) ![Focus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Focus-Performance%20%26%20Security-green)

### 🎯 Project Overview
This repository demonstrates the implementation of the **Backend for Frontend (BFF)** pattern using Next.js App Router (Route Handlers).

It addresses common challenges in modern microservices architectures, such as **Client-Side Waterfalls**, **Over-fetching**, and **exposed API endpoints**, by introducing a dedicated aggregation layer.

---

### 🏗️ The Architectural Problem
In a typical distributed system, a Frontend application (Dashboard) often needs to fetch data from multiple independent services (User, Orders, Recommendations).

**❌ Without BFF (Client-Side Fetching):**
1.  **Latency:** The browser makes 3 separate HTTP requests (Waterfall effect).
2.  **Over-fetching:** Services return huge JSON objects, but the UI only needs 10% of that data.
3.  **Security Risk:** API endpoints and potentially sensitive logic are exposed to the client.

---

### ✅ The Solution: Aggregation Layer
This project implements a **Next.js Route Handler** as a BFF layer that:
1.  **Aggregates:** Fetches data from multiple upstream services in parallel (Server-Side).
2.  **Transforms:** Filters and shapes the data (DTO Mapping) before sending it to the client.
3.  **Optimizes:** Reduces the payload size and establishes a single connection point for the Frontend.

    end
    
    User --> BFF

    Recs --> BFF
    
    BFF -- 3. Aggregated JSON --> Client
```
